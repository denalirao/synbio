    <center> <h3> A Primer in Biological Research at Tufts </h3> </center>
    <center> Fall 2014 </center> <br>
      Biology and the life sciences have experienced extensive innovations over the last half 
      century. Researchers at Tufts have been consistent contributors to these major advancements 
      making their work pertinent teaching material for students interested in pursuing research 
      opportunities. In this course, undergraduates will not only be able to explore the landscape of 
      biological research performed at Tufts, but engage in discussions with the faculty behind it. 
      Over the course of the semester, the students will become acquainted with various research 
      publications by creating presentations, drafting proposals, and discussing the research with 
      faculty and peers. The course will culminate in group proposals in which the students develop
      a potential research endeavor based on the principles examined throughout the course. 
      Students will have the opportunity to have these proposals funded with the help of the Tufts 
      Synthetic Biology team.
      The goal of the Tufts Synthetic Biology team has been to establish an undergraduate team of 
      researchers who will work closely with select faculty to take part in an annual competition, 
      learn about research on campus, discuss bioethics, and learn how to write a research proposal.
      We believe the best way to intellectually prime and train undergraduates who want to take 
      part in this highly independent research project is through a class which exposes them not
      only to the technical aspects of the molecular biology techniques involved but also to the
      administrative necessities of running an independent lab. Students taking this course will be 
      prepared to pursue undergraduate research in a professorâ€™s lab or as a member of the Tufts
      Synthetic Biology team.

      <h4> Student Involvement: </h4> 
      Before guest lectures, the class will receive papers written by the visiting lecturer. A one-
      page summary and reflection of the publication is to be completed for the following class 
      during which discussion of the article will occur. All students must also be prepared for the 
      question and answer session which will follow the guest lecture. <br>
      For a set amount of time each class, students will divide into their groups to discuss the 
      semester project and pose questions to the instructors. Project checkpoints will also be 
      required for the 4th, 7th, and 9th weeks of the course to ensure all students are progressing at a 
      sufficient pace. <br><br>
      <h4> Final Project Description: </h4> 
      All semester projects include the following: <br>
      - 3 project checkpoints <br>
      - At minimum, a single page summary of the studentâ€™s role within and understanding of 
      the project. <br>
      - A presentation to the class <br>
      Project Options: <br>
      - (Group) Synthetic Biology Proposals (7-10 pages) <br>
      - (Individual) Extended Proposals from Publications Review (3-5 Pages) <br>
      A final paper detailing a project proposal for a future synthetic biology project that could 
      be pursued by the iGEM team. <br><br>
