        <h4>Christopher Ghadban </h4>
           Christopher Ghadban graduated from Tufts University in May 2014 in Chemical Engineering
            and Biotechnology. Since his freshman year, he held leadership roles in various organizations; 
            these include the position of Education Committee Chair and Class of 2014 Representative to the 
            Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate and student representative to the School of Engineering 
            Curriculum Committee. More recently, Mr. Ghadban has led electrochemical research at 
            Reactive Innovations and directed The Future of Phage and Synthetic Biology, a conference on 
            bacteriophage application. As a founding director of the Tufts Synthetic Biology, he believes 
            the organization is a chance to expand one’s knowledge and provide experience in more self-
            directed research than is otherwise available to undergraduate students.

        <h4>Michaela Gold </h4>
        Michaela Gold is a current sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Biology and Biotechnology. She is currently studying DNA fragility in S. Pombe yeast with the Freudenreich lab. Michaela has a strong passion for molecular biology and microbiology, which she hopes to eventually use to enter the biotechnology field and research new drugs. Besides Tufts iGEM, Michaela is an avid rock climber and a member of the Tufts Climbing Team.

        <h4>Connor McBrine </h4>
        Connor McBrine is a junior pursuing majors in Biology and Biotechnology. Several of his courses in genetics and molecular biology revealed the immense potential of synthetic biology in healthcare and industry.  In addition to iGEM, Connor works to better understand DNA repair pathways in Drosophila with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. He hopes to eventually use this technology to develop therapies and even cures for genetic disorders. Various positions teaching students about biology and previous work as an EMT have also instilled Connor with a strong interest in scientific education and medicine, both of which he hopes to one day incorporate into a career in biology. In his free time, Connor enjoys reading about military history and discovering new music at local concerts.

        Jesse Starger is a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering. Jesse
        has research experience in the polymer field as he continues to work in the Yi lab with overarching 
        interests in sustainable and environmental engineering. Outside of class, Jesse is a member of the Tufts 
        University Men’s Rugby Football Club in addition to being the Eco-Rep for his dorm. While with the Tufts 
        iGEM Team, Jesse hopes to increase his exposure to other academic fields through more independent 
        forms of study than what a traditional undergraduate education may typically allow.

        <h4>Petar Todorov </h4>
        Petar Todorov is a senior majoring in chemistry with an established tradition in research. During the
        last five years he has worked on projects spanning biophysics, molecular biology, and biomedical 
        engineering. He currently works on elucidating restriction enzyme mechanisms in the Walt group at 
        Tufts. Mr. Todorov established Tufts iGEM in early 2013. Since then he has worked to help the group 
        secure funding, laboratory space, and faculty support in addition to guiding literature searches and 
        drafting proposals outlining potential routes of research. Beyond the bench, he is interested in the 
        intersection science, technology, society, and ethics. Mr. Todorov was one of the students involved 
        in organizing the Institute of Global Leadership’s 2013 professional workshop focused on Privacy and 
        Progress in Whole Genome Sequencing. Outside the lab Petar enjoys travel, photography, and reading in 
        Bulgarian, English, and Latin.
